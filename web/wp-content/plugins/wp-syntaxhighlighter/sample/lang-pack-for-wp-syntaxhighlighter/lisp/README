Based on the Lisp brush for 1.5 by Sanghyuk Suh to be found at http://han9kin.doesntexist.com/22

Still in early version but does basic highlighting. When I find my copy of "Ansi Common Lisp" I'll work to get the keyword/funcs/operators list more complete and correct. 

Patches/pulls more than welcome.
